        * Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive
        an Apple Gift Card when they purchase an Eligible Product at a
        Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may
        vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product
        per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies
        last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value
        of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will
        be charged for all items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card.
        Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement
        for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this
        promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option
        available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a
        discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the
        Eligible Product. This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12
        months for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit, and a
        second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the
        Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate
        ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of
        the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and
        be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable
        discount off the Eligible Product. Apple Card Monthly Installments
        (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select
        it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple
        Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling
        1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102730"
          >support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a
        >
        for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based
        on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card
        on and or after February 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other
        than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates
        as of February 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer
        Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible
        product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using
        ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0%
        APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable
        APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select
        AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone
        purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at
        any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the
        following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating
        corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small
        businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or
        on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will
        be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly
        payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any
        reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and
        eligible products. See
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102730"
          >support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a
        >
        for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple
        Card Customer Agreement for more information about ACMI financing. Apple
        Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch.
